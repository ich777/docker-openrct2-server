# OpenRCT2 Dedicated Server in Docker optimized for Unraid

This Docker will download and install the preferred version of OpenRCT2.

*** Manual Installation: You can also drop a custom version (even a develop version) into the root of the server and restart the Docker, it will automaticaly install it (don' forget to set the variable 'GAME_VERSION' to that version that you are installing).
Update Notice: If you want to update or downgrade the game simply change the version number.

## Env params

| Name | Value | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SERVER_DIR | Folder for gamefiles | /serverdata/serverfiles |
| GAME_CONFIG | Commandline startup parameters | --password Docker |
| GAME_VERSION | Preferred game version | 0.2.2 |
| GAME_SAVE_NAME | Savegame to laod | docker.sv6 |
| ADMIN_NAME | The username that should become an admin if he connects | user |
| ADMIN_HASH | The hash of the admin user (you find it on the client computer in the user-data/keys folder - if nothing is in there try to connect and the game will create the hash, it's the numbers and letters after the username without '-' and the ending '.pubkey' or just turn on 'log_server_actions' in the 'config.ini' on the server and you'll find it in the logs | *hash* |
| UID | User Identifier | 99 |
| GID | Group Identifier | 100 |
| GAME_PORT | Port the server will be running on | 11753 |

>**ATTENTION:** The variables ADMIN_NAME & ADMIN_HASH will only work on the first time you enter these, after that you must change it manually in '/SERVER_DIR/user-data/users.json'.
